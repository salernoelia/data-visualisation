# Cuby

Module: Data Visualisation  <br>
Group: Basil Egger, Irina Ležaić, Hyejin Shim, Elia Salerno



## Task
For this module, we were able to collaborate with the ETH Crowther Lab and focusTerra to create an "Interactive Mapping Table" as part of the immersive exhibition "KEEP IT CO2OL: Tech to the rescue?" from November 2024 to April 2026. The objective is to inform and engage the Swiss public, especially students, on nature-based solutions for CO2 storage and climate data. The exhibit aims to showcase the carbon storage potential of natural ecosystems, present case studies of successful conservation and regeneration projects worldwide, and convey key messages from the Crowther Lab about the importance of restoring ecosystems for carbon sequestration.

## Documentation
In this Repository we documented all the experiments we did for this module. 
The latest version we did of our final "Cuby" graph, is located in the folder "16-dynamic-3d-icicle" and is a standalone Nuxt application. It uses both d3.js as well as three.js to visualize the data. It isn't finished since the time ran out to complete it/work further on it sadly, so there are no filter controls and the data with null is still visible as flat planes.
